              The human body has over 600 muscles. Muscle tissue makes up about
              40% of body weight. Skeletal muscles, together with their skeletal
              system, perform two very important functions in the human body:
              movement and defense. Skeletal muscle tissue enables conscious
              voluntary movements of the body and its parts. In this case, two
              seemingly opposite tasks are performed: both the beginning of the
              movement and its control. Find out how this system works,
              everything is easier than it seems, read it!

            <p>
              Fatigue, exhaustion and overtraining are very close to each other
              and are easily confused in the initial stages. There is a
              temporary "bust" in loads when you have surpassed yourself, and
              now, of course, are exhausted, but this will be followed by
              super-compensation and reaching a new level. And it happens, in
              fact, overtraining - an unexpected deterioration in results
              further intensifies, stopping your progress for a long time. How
              to diagnose these conditions, the balance between load and rest,
              progress, read here

                You know that macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates)
                provide the calories the body needs to function. While all
                macronutrients contain calories, each nutrient has unique
                properties and effects. Therefore, it is important to know the
                property and function of each element! Since protein has the
                greatest impact on body composition, health, functionality, and
                should be a priority in a structured diet, we'll start our
                nutrient introduction with it!

            <p>
              Today, the average person gains from 0.5-0.9 kg per year, and this
              is not a set of muscle tissue, but adipose tissue! There are
              several reasons for this, but today we'll talk about hunger and
              the cult of food! Today people do eat more! Moreover, most often,
              they get their excess of calories from food for pleasure, out of
              boredom! The social factor also takes part in this, 1-2 coffee and
              cake a day for the company, dinner with alcohol with friends, and
              so on. Well, don't forget about hunger and overeating because of
              their effects! Either way, understanding and managing hunger can
              improve diet success and your comfort towards any goal. So read

                Alcohol is both a drink and a drug at the same time. For
                thousands of years, alcohol has been consumed for medical,
                festive and ritual purposes. It is drunk in almost every country
                and often in excessive quantities. But no one thinks about how
                our body assimilates, processes and removes the products of its
                decay! Today we will talk about it!
